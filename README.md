# Gielinor Gains RuneLite Plugin

A RuneLite plugin that brings [GielinorGains.com](https://gielinorgains.com) trading opportunities directly into your OSRS client. Completely free with intelligent trading tools - no subscriptions, just profitable Grand Exchange opportunities.

## Score System

Higher scores indicate better profit opportunities with executable trades. Our algorithm analyzes technical indicators (RSI, ROC, MACD), trading volume, market depth, and contrarian signals to score items 0-5.

Scores currently range 2.4-3.0, but small differences matter significantly. Our algorithm focuses on asymmetric opportunities where wins outweigh losses - even moderate accuracy can yield exceptional returns.

Focus on relative position in the results table. A 0.1 point difference can mean 10x more trading volume, better profit margins, or the difference between oversold (RSI 25) and neutral (RSI 50) conditions.

## Smart Offers

No guesswork - the system finds the optimal balance between profit margin and execution speed for current market conditions. Our dynamic pricing calculates buy/sell offers automatically using latest prices with smart offsets (0.08-2%) based on liquidity, technical conditions, and volatility. All calculations include the 2% GE tax.

## Quantities

Get realistic quantity suggestions that actually execute. Recommendations are calculated conservatively based on actual trading volume with confidence scoring, automatically adjusting for market liquidity to avoid inflated suggestions.
